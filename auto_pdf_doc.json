With a land area of approximately 462,840 km\u00b2, it is slightly larger than California (Wikipedia, 2025). PNG is one of the most culturally diverse countries, with over 800 languages spoken, though English is the official language. The capital, Port Moresby, has a population slightly smaller than Miami, Florida of 420,000 (World Population Overview, 2025). Despite its size, nearly 70% of the country remains unexplored. With a population of 10.7 million (Worldometer, 2025), transportation beyond ports relies on road, air, and river networks to reach remote areas.",

The road network has historically suffered from underfunding of maintenance activities, leading to deterioration of infrastructure shortly after construction. The Department of Works and Highways is working on reforming maintenance systems, including implementing performance-based contracts to improve efficiency and accountability. Nevertheless, persistent funding gaps, limited local contractor capacity, and corruption risks undermine progress. Routine and emergency maintenance is essential, especially on roads affected by frequent landslides and erosion, but the capacity to respond quickly and adequately is often lacking.

Road Security Security on the roads in Papua New Guinea is a critical national concern, especially along key transport corridors such as the Highlands Highway and feeder roads to remote regions. Criminal activity, including armed hold-ups, roadblocks, and cargo theft, is a regular threat that affects both passenger and freight transport. The Highlands region, despite being one of the most economically significant areas due to its agricultural output, is also notorious for security risks, with criminal gangs (\"raskols\") frequently targeting vehicles, particularly those carrying valuable goods like fuel, food supplies, and mining equipment.
